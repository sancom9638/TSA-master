                    The Stellar Propulsion System (SPS), is a cutting-edge, hybrid engine that combines elements of traditional rocket propulsion with lighter-than-air technology. This unique engine was specifically designed to power high-altitude balloon flights for space tourists.
                    The SPS consists of a compact, yet powerful, rocket motor that generates sufficient thrust to carry the balloon to the lower reaches of space. The engine is fueled by a mixture of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, which provides clean, efficient and reliable propulsion. The balloon itself is made of a lightweight and durable material that can withstand the harsh conditions of the upper atmosphere.
